# Chia-Offers-Decompression

run decompresser.py to decompressor a chia offer file. value x respresents a test offer. any offer can be replaced with x in decompress.py and it will decompress to a list of data compressed with zlib. currently working on further decompressing the zlib list to hrf.

The basic idea is to decompress an offer file without having to run a rpc command to a chia node.
